## Situation: A Flight of Fancy

**Narration:**  
**{player}** is helping Akino with her shopping.

**Akino:**  
Well, that was a fruitful outing!  
Thankfully, I had you to show me the way.

**Akino:**  
I had heard there was a lovely shop nearby,  
but I simply couldn't find it on my own...  
Luckily, you knew exactly where it was.

**Akino:**  
I mean, would you look at this gorgeous necklace?  
The way it glitters and sparkles is so pretty.  
Why, it's almost like it's glowing itself...

**Akino:**  
Wh-what's this?  
It really is glowing...!  
This light, it seems somehow familiar...

**Schoolboy:**  
Hey, **{player}**, this class really sucks, huh?  
I can't wait for it to be over.

**Schoolboy:**  
Hm? **{player}**, your phone's ringing.

**Teacher:**  
Excuse me, **{player}**, I thought I made it clear that  
mobile phones are to be turned off during class!

**Choice 1. Sorry...**  

`---tag1---`  
**Teacher:**  
If it's an emergency, you may go use your phone in the hallway.  

**Choice 2. Leave the classroom and answer the phone.**  

`---tag2---`  
**Akino:**  
Oh, there you are, **{player}**.  
Good morning. Lovely weather we're having today.
